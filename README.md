    <h1>
      Ever heard of coding and medical sciences coming together for the improval of technology.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Certainly sure you have never heard of such, well let me take you through the MAGNIFICENT dream i have for this field as a young coder  
    </h2>
    <p>
      With ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Coding can be useful in developing AI systems that analyze medical images and assist with diagnosis. 
      Coding can be used to develop algorithms that help identify the best treatments for individual patients based on their specific genetic makeup and medical 
      history.
      We all know that data is analyzed in hospitals but it become a long process which is mostly time consuming due to a lot of pupils but with coding technology it 
      can be used 
      to analyze large data sets from medical studies and clinical trials, helping to identify patterns and correlations 
      AND life is easier that WAY!!!!
